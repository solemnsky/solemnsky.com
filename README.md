# the solemnsky website

Our website should present a clear identity for the solemnsky project to the public.

The principle selling points of solemnsky are those summarized in our mantra, "the open-source competitive multiplayer 2D plane game". More precisely:

 * open-source: Beyond OSS principles, we cater to developers by way of providing a friendly modding API.
 * competitive: Let it be known that solemnsky is not merely a casual game! Our philosophy should distinguish competitive play.
 * multiplayer: Meet new people, and then blow them up!
 * 2D: The graphics of the game will be essentially glorified 2D graphics. This is a unique and important part of what solemnsky is.
 * plane game: At the end of the day, solemnsky's all about flying planes. How does it feel to fly through an open sky, evade an enemy with an elaborate maneuver, fire your cannons? This element should be part of the atmosphere created by the site.

It's important to depict these points clearly, in order to establish an clear and honest image of what solemnsky is, and ultimately pitch the project to the audience that can appreciate it best.


### TODO LIST 

 * solemnsky manifesto, for the about page on the site
